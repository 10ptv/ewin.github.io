To create a chat messenger that allows users to chat with each other on your website, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a database table:
   - Create a new table in your WordPress database to store the chat messages.
   - Include columns for message ID, sender ID, receiver ID, message content, timestamp, and any other relevant information.

2. Create the chat interface:
   - Create a new PHP file, e.g., "chat.php", to handle the chat interface.
   - Add HTML markup to display the chat interface, including a message input field and a chat message container.
   - Use CSS to style the chat interface to your liking.

3. Implement the chat functionality:
   - Use JavaScript to handle the real-time updating of chat messages.
   - Create JavaScript functions to send and receive messages using AJAX requests.
   - When a user sends a message, use AJAX to send the message data to a PHP script that will insert the message into the database.
   - Use AJAX to periodically fetch new messages from the database and update the chat message container.

Remember to sanitize and validate user input to prevent any security vulnerabilities.
