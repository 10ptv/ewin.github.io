To achieve this, we'll need to modify the code and add new functionality to handle file uploads and store them in a separate folder. Here's the updated code:

1. Create a folder for storing customer lists:
   - Create a new folder in the root directory of your WordPress installation called "customer-list".

2. Modify the login form:
   - Update the `login.php` file to include the necessary code for storing user information in the database.
   - Use PHP's `password_hash()` function to securely hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
   - Use prepared statements or an ORM library like Eloquent to protect against SQL injection attacks.

3. Create a video upload page:
   - Create a new PHP file called "upload.php" in your theme's directory.
   - Add HTML markup for the video upload form, including an input field of type "file" for selecting the video file.
   - Use PHP's `move_uploaded_file()` function to move the uploaded file to the "customer-list" folder.
   - Store the file information in the database, including the file name, file path, and any other relevant information.

4. Increase file upload size limit:
   - Edit your server's PHP configuration file (php.ini) and increase the `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` directives to allow file uploads larger than 1GB.
   - Restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Remember to validate and sanitize user input, handle validation errors, and add appropriate error messages to ensure the security and usability of your application.
